// Increment by 10

// Write a for loop that uses a counter variable initialized at 5 and then increments 
// it by 10 every time it executes. Use console.log() to output the value of the counter 
// variable each time through the loop. Stop execution of the loop if the counter variable's 
// value is greater than 120.

// Example output:

// Current value is 5

// Current value is 15

// Current value is 25
